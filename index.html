        <p>
            you got a website running in a night!!!! if you know html, css, or javascript you can make a way prettier website than this! if you want to use php, check out
            <a href='http://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx'>this link</a> because php requires a bit more effort to set up.
            (as an aside, one perk (or drawback) of apache over nginx is that due to its unholy matrimony with php it requires no additional configuration to enable php)
